1. For simplicity, PHPs inbuilt multi exec or async curl is used
2. When going in production or in terms of scalability, other options like RabbitMQ, ReactPHP could be explored

4. The file libMultiCurl.php can be expanded to be used as library file with some changes
5. Focus was more on executing the requests concurrently and hence use of async curl
